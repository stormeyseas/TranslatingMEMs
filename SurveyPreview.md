## **Section 4: Reflections on AI Use**

**Q15.** To what extent do you agree that each of the following is a potential benefit or risk of AI-assisted modelling?  
_(Likert scale: Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree)_
- Time savings  
- Improved reproducibility  
- Enhanced model complexity or scope

- Novel insights or emergent patterns  
- Better documentation or traceability  
- Increased accessibility for non-experts  
- Over-reliance on automation  
- Reduced transparency or interpretability  
- Misinterpretation of model outputs  
- Ethical concerns (e.g., bias, accountability)  
- Difficulty tracing errors or debugging  
- Loss of domain expertise in decision-making  
- Inappropriate generalisation or extrapolation
