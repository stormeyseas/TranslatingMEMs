☐ FishPATH
☐ Other (please specify): ___________

How would you rate the usefulness of the AI tool in assisting with model translation?

☐ Not useful
☐ Somewhat useful
☐ Useful
☐ Very useful

Which aspects of the modelling task did the AI assist with most effectively?
(e.g., data formatting, parameter estimation, documentation)

Were there any tasks the AI attempted but failed to complete adequately?
