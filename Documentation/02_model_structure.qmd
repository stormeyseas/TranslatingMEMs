# Overview

This document details the conceptual design and structural decisions for translating the Dahood et al. (2019) Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model of the Western Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem into a size-based multi-species model using the `mizer` package in R.

The Dahood et al. (2019) EwE model contains **35 functional groups** representing the complete food web from phytoplankton to apex predators. The translation to mizer requires careful consideration of which groups can be represented as size-structured species versus resources, and how to preserve the key ecological interactions while working within mizer's framework.

## Key Structural Decisions

Based on analysis of the EwE model structure, forcing functions (Table 3 in Dahood et al. 2019), diet composition, and project objectives, the following key decisions were made:

1. **Comprehensive species representation**: Include all major consumer groups as size-structured species to maintain calibration capability for the 8 monitored species and preserve important predator-prey dynamics
2. **Extended single resource spectrum**: Use a single extended resource spectrum (1e-10 to 10 g) representing all lower trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton, ice algae, benthic organic matter), forced by zooplankton dynamics to avoid temporal mismatches
3. **Krill as size-structured species**: Model Antarctic krill as a full size-structured species (combining EwE's two stanzas) to explicitly represent the fishery and complex trophic role
4. **Marine mammals and seabirds included**: Represent all marine mammal and seabird groups as size-structured species, following approaches used in previous mizer applications to whales

# EwE Model Summary

## Original EwE Functional Groups

The Dahood et al. (2019) EwE model includes 35 functional groups:

### Marine Mammals (11 groups)
1. Killer whales (*Orcinus orca*)
2. Leopard Seal (*Hydrurga leptonyx*)
3. Weddell Seal (*Leptonychotes weddellii*)

31. Macro-Zooplankton (>2000 μm)
32. Small Phytoplankton (<20 μm)
33. Large Phytoplankton (>20 μm)
34. Ice Algae (sea ice-associated microalgae)
35. Detritus

## Key EwE Model Features

### Biomass Distribution
- **Highest biomass groups**: Benthic invertebrates (8554 t/km²), Salps (16,000 t/km²), Large krill (8126 t/km²), Other euphausiids (14,800 t/km²)
- **Phytoplankton**: Model-calculated to balance primary production (EE = 0.5)
- **Marine mammals**: Generally low biomass (0.001-110 t/km²) but ecologically important
- **Fish**: Moderate biomass (0.14-525 t/km²)

### Trophic Structure
- **Krill-centric ecosystem**: Antarctic krill appears in diets of most predators (12+ species consume >30% krill)
- **Multiple trophic pathways**: 
  - Ice algae → Krill → Predators
  - Phytoplankton → Zooplankton → Fish → Predators
  - Benthic pathway → Demersal fish → Predators
- **Trophic levels**: Range from 1.0 (primary producers) to 4.72 (Killer whales)

### Calibration and Forcing
Dahood et al. (2019) successfully calibrated their model using:

- **Sea-ice forcing**: Applied to multiple predator-prey interactions and used to drive krill and *G. gibberifrons* biomass via functional response curves
- **Open water forcing**: Applied to gentoo penguins, fur seals, and other ice-avoiding species
- **Chlorophyll-a forcing**: Applied to primary producers
- **Observed predation rates**: Leopard seal predation on fur seal pups

**Forcing function applications retained in final EwE model** (from Table 3):

- 10 predators had forced interactions with their prey
- Forcing reduced sum of squares by 65% compared to unfocused model
- Largest impacts: Ice algae vulnerability to krill (1.48 SS reduction), Chinstrap penguin-krill interaction (1.33 SS reduction)

# Mizer Model Structure

## Size-Structured Species (26 species)

The following groups from the EwE model will be represented as size-structured species in mizer:

### Fish and Cephalopods (6 species)

| Species | EwE Group | Biomass (t/km²) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| Cephalopods | Cephalopods | 2.49 | Important prey for marine mammals |
| Myctophids | Myctophids | 3.27 | Key mesopelagic fish |
| On-shelf fish | On-shelf fish | 5.25 | Multi-species demersal group |
| *Notothenia rossii* | N. rossii | 0.138 | Commercially important toothfish |
| *Champsocephalus gunnari* | C. gunnari | 0.9 | Monitored icefish |
| *Gobionotothen gibberifrons* | G. gibberifrons | 1.2 | Monitored, declined significantly |

**Ecological role**: Mid-trophic level consumers, prey for marine mammals and seabirds

### Euphausiids (2 species)

| Species | EwE Groups | Biomass (t/km²) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| Antarctic Krill | Krill Large + Krill Small | 81.26 + 28.93 | **Key species**: Combines both EwE stanzas into single size-structured species; target of commercial fishery |
| Other Euphausiids | Other Euphausiids | 148 | Non-*E. superba* euphausiids |

**Rationale for krill as species**: 

- Explicit representation of krill fishery
- Central role in food web (consumed by 20+ species)
- Size-dependent predation dynamics
- Can be driven by sea-ice forcing as in EwE model
- EwE used multi-stanza approach (small/large separated by age 24 months); mizer naturally represents size structure

### Seals (6 species)

| Species | EwE Group | Biomass (t/km²) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| Killer Whale | Killer whales | 0.0075 | Apex predator, forced interactions in EwE |
| Leopard Seal | Leopard Seal | 0.0084 | **Monitored**, forced interactions, unique predator on seals/penguins |
| Weddell Seal | Weddell Seal | 0.081 | Benthic feeder, different from other seals |
| Crabeater Seal | Crabeater Seal | 1.098 | **Highest biomass seal**, krill specialist (78% diet) |
| Antarctic Fur Seal | Antarctic fur seals | 0.0010 | **Monitored**, forced interactions in EwE, important for calibration |
| S. Elephant Seal | S Elephant Seals | 0.0010 | Deep-diving cephalopod specialist |

**Ecological role**: Top predators, diverse feeding strategies (krill specialists, fish feeders, apex predators)

**Rationale for inclusion**: 

- Antarctic Fur Seal is monitored and has calibration time series
- Leopard Seal has forced interactions in EwE (Table 3)
- Crabeater Seal has highest biomass among seals
- Each seal has distinct diet (cannot aggregate)
- Killer Whale is apex predator with unique role

### Whales (5 species)

| Species | EwE Group | Biomass (t/km²) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| Sperm Whale | Sperm Whales | 0.0284 | Deep-diving cephalopod specialist (85% cephalopods) |
| Blue Whale | Blue Whales | 0.0072 | Krill specialist (61% krill + 39% other euphausiids/zooplankton) |
| Fin Whale | Fin Whales | 0.0428 | Krill specialist (71% krill), increasing population (EE = 0.98) |
| Minke Whale | Minke Whales | 0.0473 | Krill specialist (76% krill) |
| Humpback Whale | Humpback whales | 0.0812 | **Increasing population** (4.5% yr⁻¹), krill specialist (76% krill) |

**Ecological role**: Large-bodied krill and cephalopod consumers

**Rationale for separate species** (not aggregated despite diet similarity):

- Humpback whale population increasing (biomass accumulation term in EwE)
- Different body sizes affect size-based predation
- Potential differential responses to climate change
- Previous mizer studies have successfully modeled whales (will research parameterization approaches)

### Penguins (5 species)

| Species | EwE Group | Biomass (t/km²) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| Emperor Penguin | Emperor Penguins | 0.00012 | Low biomass but ecologically distinct (winter breeder) |
| Gentoo Penguin | Gentoo Penguins | 0.00116 | **Monitored**, increasing, open water forager, forced interactions in EwE |
| Chinstrap Penguin | Chinstrap Penguins | 0.0214 | **Monitored**, declining, forced interactions in EwE |
| Adélie Penguin | Adelie Penguins | 0.00583 | **Monitored**, declining, ice-associated |
| Macaroni Penguin | Macaroni Penguins | 0.00011 | Moderate diet diversity (34% krill, 35% other euphausiids) |

**Ecological role**: Intermediate predators, krill-dependent, key indicators of ecosystem change

**Rationale for keeping all 5 species separate**:

- Three species (Gentoo, Chinstrap, Adélie) are monitored with time series for calibration
- Each has distinct response to sea ice (increasing vs. declining)
- Forced interactions in EwE calibration (Table 3)
- Different foraging strategies (ice-associated vs. open water)

### Other Consumers (2 species)

| Species | EwE Group | Biomass (t/km²) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------------|
| Flying Birds | Flying Birds | 0.004 | Multi-species aggregate (petrels, albatrosses, etc.) |
| Salps | Salps | 320 | **Very high biomass**, potential krill competitor, respond to warming |

**Rationale for inclusion**:

- **Flying Birds**: Represents important seabird predation not captured by penguins; moderate diet diversity
- **Salps**: Critical for climate change scenarios; EwE notes salps may replace krill in warming areas; very high biomass

## Resource Spectrum (Extended Single Spectrum)

Mizer will use a single extended resource spectrum to represent all lower trophic levels, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, ice algae, and detrital/benthic organic matter. This pragmatic approach ensures adequate resource availability while avoiding temporal dynamics mismatches.

### Extended Resource Spectrum

**EwE groups represented**:

- Small Phytoplankton (<20 μm)
- Large Phytoplankton (>20 μm)
- Ice Algae (sea ice-associated microalgae)
- Micro-Zooplankton (<200 μm)
- Meso-Zooplankton (200-2000 μm)
- Macro-Zooplankton (>2000 μm)
- Benthic Invertebrates (accessible fraction)
- Detrital aggregates and organic particles

**Total EwE biomass**: ~37,786 t/km² (Phytoplankton: ~28,735, Zooplankton: 190, Ice algae: ~307, Benthic: 8,554)

**Mizer implementation**:

- Single continuous size spectrum spanning from smallest phytoplankton to large zooplankton/organic particles
- **Size range**: 1e-10 g to 10 g (~0.1 μm to ~20 mm equivalent diameter)
  - Small end (1e-10 to 1e-6 g): Phytoplankton-sized particles
  - Medium (1e-6 to 0.01 g): Zooplankton
  - Large end (0.01 to 10 g): Large zooplankton, organic aggregates, accessible detritus
- **Target biomass**: ~5,000-10,000 t/km² (conservative fraction of total EwE resources)
- **Forcing strategy**: Driven by ISIMIP3a zooplankton data only:
  - `zmicro-vint` (microzooplankton)
  - `zmeso-vint` (mesozooplankton)
- **Regeneration rate**: ~10 per year (appropriate for zooplankton dynamics)

**Rationale for single extended spectrum**:

1. **Zooplankton integration**: Zooplankton biomass already integrates phytoplankton dynamics through trophic interactions, providing a time-lagged signal that represents food availability
2. **Consumer perspective**: Most modeled species feed on zooplankton rather than directly on phytoplankton; Antarctic krill consume copepods, not diatoms directly
3. **Temporal stability**: Zooplankton dynamics are more stable than phytoplankton boom-bust cycles, avoiding forcing mismatches
4. **Size coverage**: Extended range ensures prey availability for all consumer size classes from krill (≥0.1 g) to large predators
5. **Standard mizer approach**: Works within mizer's single-resource framework without requiring custom code

**Conceptual model**: The extended spectrum represents the continuum of "available organic matter" in the ecosystem, with biomass dynamics driven by the functional prey pool (zooplankton) that consumers actually access.

**Ecological importance**:

- Provides adequate energy base for entire consumer community (corrects for initial 99.5% resource deficit)
- Captures key ecosystem pathways (phytoplankton → zooplankton → krill/fish → predators)
- Enables size-based feeding dynamics across full trophic spectrum
- Can be refined in future with size-dependent forcing if needed (small sizes: phyto, large sizes: zoo)

## Species Excluded / Incorporated into Resources

The following EwE group is **not** explicitly represented:

- **Detritus** (5.77 t/km² input): Mizer does not explicitly model detritus. The detrital pathway is implicitly included through:

  - Natural mortality contributing to resource production
  - Unassimilated consumption creating nutrient recycling
  - Resource spectrum regeneration rates

# Predator-Prey Interaction Framework

## Size-Based Predation

Mizer uses size-based predation where predators consume prey within a preferred size range determined by:

- **Predator-Prey Mass Ratio (PPMR)**: The preferred ratio of predator size to prey size (β)
- **Feeding kernel width (σ)**: How selective predators are about prey size
- **Interaction matrix**: Species-specific preferences for prey types

### Deriving Mizer Interactions from EwE Diet Matrix

The EwE diet matrix (Table 1 in Dahood et al. 2019) provides the proportion of each prey in each predator's diet. This will be translated to mizer's interaction matrix as follows:

**For interactions between size-structured species**:

- EwE diet proportions → mizer interaction matrix elements
- Size-based feeding kernel determines actual consumption based on sizes
- Example: Leopard Seal consumes 70% Large Krill in EwE → High interaction coefficient for Leopard Seal-Krill pair

**For interactions with resource spectrum**:

- Species feeding on plankton/resources in EwE → Interactions with extended resource spectrum
- Example: Krill consumes 50% Large phytoplankton, 10% ice algae, 10% meso-zooplankton → All represented as interactions with the extended resource spectrum, with size-based feeding determining actual prey selection
- Benthic feeders → Feed on larger size classes within the extended resource spectrum (representing accessible benthic organic matter)

### Key Trophic Interactions to Preserve

Based on EwE forcing functions (Table 3) and diet analysis, the following interactions are particularly important:

**Ice Algae → Krill** (Strongest forcing effect in EwE):

- Large Krill: 10% ice algae in diet, forcing applied to vulnerability and arena area
- Small Krill: 25% ice algae in diet, forcing applied with sea ice index
- **Mizer implementation**: Sea ice forcing can modulate resource availability or krill recruitment to represent ice algae effects on krill dynamics

**Krill → Multiple Predators** (Central hub):
20+ species consume krill, with varying dependencies:

- High dependence (>70% diet): Chinstrap (95%), Adélie (96%), Crabeater Seal (78%), Minke (76%), Humpback (76%), Gentoo (80%)
- Moderate dependence (30-70%): Fin (71%), Blue (61%), Emperor (52%), Fur Seal (50%), Cephalopods (40%)
- **Mizer implementation**: High interaction coefficients for krill specialists; size-based feeding kernels determine actual consumption

**Open Water Predators** (Forced in EwE with open water area):

- Gentoo Penguin → On-shelf fish and Krill (forced with open water)
- Antarctic Fur Seal → Cephalopods, On-shelf fish, Krill (forced with open water)
- **Mizer implementation**: Can incorporate habitat-based interaction modulation

**Benthic Pathway**:

- Benthic Invertebrates → *G. gibberifrons* (59%), Weddell Seal (5%), Cephalopods (21%)
- **Mizer implementation**: Larger size classes in extended resource spectrum represent accessible benthic organic matter; demersal feeders preferentially feed on these larger resource sizes

**Sea Ice-Driven Biomass** (EwE used response curves):

- Sea ice index → Large Krill biomass (sigmoidal response, largest biomass driver)
- Sea ice index → *G. gibberifrons* biomass (linear response)
- **Mizer implementation**: Will need to research mizer capabilities for environmental forcing of recruitment/mortality

## Fishing

**Krill Fishery**:

- Only commercial fishery in Statistical Subarea 48.1
- EwE average catch 1995-2001: ~51,000 tonnes
- Recent catches (2010s): >150,000 tonnes in area 48.1
- **Mizer implementation**: Size-selective fishing mortality on Antarctic Krill species

**Historical Fish Fisheries** (ceased before model period):

- *N. rossii*, *C. gunnari* were historically fished but not during EwE calibration period (1996-2012)
- **Mizer implementation**: Include capability to impose fishing mortality for historical scenarios if needed

ISIMIP3a fishing forcing data available:

- `effort_histsoc_1841_2017_western-antarctic-peninsula.parquet`
- Can be used to drive temporal fishing mortality

# Size Ranges and Body Size Assignments

A critical aspect of the mizer translation is assigning appropriate size ranges to each species. For groups that are not typically size-structured (e.g., adult marine mammals, adult seabirds), we need to determine how to represent them in mizer's size-based framework.

## Approach for Different Taxa

### Fish and Cephalopods

- **Standard mizer approach**: Use species-specific von Bertalanffy growth parameters
- Size ranges from recruitment size to maximum observed size (L∞)
- Literature values available for most species in Hill et al. (2007) compilation

### Euphausiids

- **Antarctic Krill**: 

  - EwE modeled as multi-stanza with transition at 24 months
  - Size range: ~10 mm (recruitment) to ~60 mm (maximum adult size)
  - Growth follows von Bertalanffy curve (K = 0.44, parameters from Rosenberg et al. 1986, Candy & Kawaguchi 2006)
  - **Mizer**: Single species spanning full size range
  
- **Other Euphausiids**: Similar size range to krill

### Marine Mammals and Seabirds
These groups present a challenge for size-based modeling. We will research how previous mizer applications have handled whales and adapt those approaches. Options include:

**Option 1: Full Life Cycle**

- Model complete size range from birth/hatching to adult
- Requires growth parameters and size-at-recruitment
- May be feasible for pinnipeds with known growth curves

**Option 2: Adult-Only Representation**

- Model only adult size classes
- Use narrow size range around adult body mass
- Simpler but loses juvenile dynamics

**Option 3: Representative Size Classes**

- Select a few key size classes to represent age structure
- Balance between biological realism and computational efficiency

**Research needed**: Review literature on mizer applications to marine mammals (if available) to determine best practice approach for parameterization.

## Preliminary Size Ranges

Based on adult body masses from literature, preliminary maximum sizes (will refine):

| Taxon | Mass Range | Notes |
|-------|------------|--------------------|
| **Fish** |  |  |
| Myctophids | 1-50 g | Small mesopelagic fish |
| *N. rossii* | 50-7000 g | Large nototheniid |
| *C. gunnari* | 50-500 g | Icefish |
| *G. gibberifrons* | 50-400 g | Smaller nototheniid |
| On-shelf fish | 10-1000 g | Multi-species average |
| Cephalopods | 100-5000 g | Squids and octopods |
| **Euphausiids** |  |  |

| **Seals** |  |  |
| Leopard Seal | 200-600 kg | Large phocid |
| Weddell Seal | 400-600 kg | Large phocid |
| Crabeater Seal | 200-300 kg | Medium phocid |
| Fur Seal | 50-200 kg | Smaller otariid |
| Elephant Seal | 500-4000 kg | Largest seal |
| Killer Whale | 3000-8000 kg | Largest odontocete |
| **Baleen Whales** |  |  |
| Minke Whale | 5000-10000 kg | Smallest baleen whale |
| Humpback Whale | 25000-40000 kg | Medium baleen whale |
| Fin Whale | 40000-80000 kg | Large baleen whale |
| Blue Whale | 80000-150000 kg | Largest animal |
| **Sperm Whale** | 15000-50000 kg | Largest odontocete |
| **Penguins** |  |  |
| Emperor Penguin | 20-45 kg | Largest penguin |
| Gentoo Penguin | 4-8 kg | Medium penguin |
| Chinstrap Penguin | 3-6 kg | Medium penguin |
| Adélie Penguin | 3-6 kg | Medium penguin |
| Macaroni Penguin | 3-6 kg | Medium penguin |
| **Other** |  |  |
| Flying Birds | 0.5-5 kg | Average across species |
| Salps | 0.001-0.1 kg | Colonial tunicates |

# Key Assumptions and Simplifications

## Assumptions Required for Translation

### 1. Size-Based Representation of Non-Fish Species

**Assumption**: Marine mammals and seabirds can be represented within mizer's size-based framework despite not exhibiting indeterminate growth

**Justification**: 

- Previous mizer studies have successfully modeled whales
- Body size still determines feeding and predation risk
- Can represent key processes (consumption, mortality, reproduction) even if growth pattern differs from fish

**Implications**:

- Will need creative parameterization approaches
- May use narrow size ranges or discrete size classes
- Growth parameters will represent maturation rather than continuous growth

### 2. Combining EwE Krill Stanzas

**Assumption**: EwE's two krill stanzas (small <24 months, large ≥24 months) can be combined into a single size-structured species

**Justification**:

- Mizer naturally represents size structure and growth through size classes
- Von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K = 0.44) can describe transition from small to large
- Size-based predation will automatically capture preferential predation on smaller vs. larger krill

**Implications**:

- Need to ensure size-based feeding kernels capture the diet differences between krill sizes in EwE
- May need to calibrate recruitment to match total krill biomass

### 3. Aggregation of Plankton Groups

**Assumption**: Multiple EwE plankton groups can be aggregated into continuous resource spectra

**Justification**:

- Standard mizer approach for lower trophic levels
- Size-based spectra can represent size diversity within functional groups
- Forcing data (ISIMIP) provides phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances

**Implications**:

- Lose discrete functional group representation
- Cannot explicitly model shifts between phytoplankton types
- Resource dynamics simplified compared to EwE

### 4. Detritus Pathway

**Assumption**: Detrital pathway can be represented implicitly through resource dynamics

**Justification**:

- Mizer does not explicitly model detritus
- Natural mortality and unassimilated consumption contribute to nutrient recycling
- Resource regeneration can implicitly represent detrital remineralization

**Implications**:

- Cannot explicitly track detritus pools
- May underestimate importance of detrital pathway for benthic communities
- energy flow through detritus is implicit rather than explicit

### 5. Spatial Homogeneity

**Assumption**: Statistical Subarea 48.1 is treated as spatially homogeneous (well-mixed)

**Justification**:

- EwE model (non-Ecospace version) also assumes spatial homogeneity
- Consistent with EwE approach being translated
- Forcing data are area-averaged

**Implications**:

- Cannot represent spatial heterogeneity in krill distribution
- Cannot model spatial MPAs without extension to spatial mizer
- May miss local depletion effects near fishing activity

### 6. Sea Ice Forcing Translation

**Assumption**: EwE's forcing functions and response curves can be translated to mizer's forcing framework

**Justification**:

- Both models can incorporate environmental forcing
- EwE demonstrated that sea ice is critical driver (65% SS reduction)
- Mizer can incorporate external factors affecting growth, mortality, or resource availability

**Challenges**:

- Need to research mizer's capabilities for environmental forcing
- May require custom functions or mizerExperimental features
- Functional response curves (e.g., sigmoidal krill response to ice) may need creative implementation

## Simplifications from EwE Model

### 1. Diet Matrix to Interaction Matrix

**Simplification**: EwE's detailed diet matrix (proportion of each prey in each predator diet) is simplified to species-level interaction coefficients combined with size-based feeding

**What is lost**:

- Age/size-specific diet information within EwE groups
- Ability to specify exact diet proportions independent of size

**What is gained**:

- Emergent diet composition based on prey size and availability
- More mechanistic representation of size-based predation

### 2. Biomass Accumulation

**Simplification**: EwE's biomass accumulation terms (Humpback whale +3.9% yr⁻¹, Fin whale +2.9% yr⁻¹) need alternative representation

**Options**:

- Adjust recruitment to create population increase
- Modify mortality schedules
- Incorporate trends in carrying capacity

**Implications**: Population trends may need to be forced rather than emergent

### 3. Forcing Function Applications

**Simplification**: EwE applied forcing functions to specific predator-prey interaction parameters (vulnerability, search rate, arena area). Mizer's forcing may work differently.

**EwE forcing preserved**:

- Sea ice effects on ice algae and krill
- Open water effects on fur seals and gentoo penguins
- Chlorophyll effects on primary production

**Challenges**: 

- Mizer may not have direct equivalents to EwE's "arena area" or "vulnerability" parameters
- May need to implement forcing through resource availability or mortality modulation

### 4. Cannibalism

**Simplification**: EwE explicitly disallowed cannibalism for all groups. Mizer's size-based predation may allow cannibalism if size ranges overlap.

**Approach**: 

- Can set interaction matrices to zero for self-interactions
- Or allow cannibalism where biologically realistic (e.g., large fish eating small conspecifics)

### 5. Multi-Species Functional Groups

**Simplification**: Some EwE multi-species groups (On-shelf fish, Flying Birds) are represented as single species in mizer

**What is lost**:

- Species diversity within functional groups
- Differential responses of component species

**Justification**:

- Insufficient data to parameterize multiple component species
- Functional group approach consistent with EwE model's own approach
- Preserves overall trophic role

# Model Parameterization Approach

The translation from EwE to mizer will preserve key parameters where possible:

## Parameters Directly Translatable

1. **Biomass** (B): EwE biomass (t/km²) → Mizer initial abundances (converted to numbers-at-size using size structure)

2. **Production to Biomass ratio** (P/B): EwE annual P/B → Related to mizer growth and mortality parameters
   - For multi-cellular organisms: P/B ≈ natural mortality M
   - Will inform background mortality (z0) in mizer

3. **Consumption to Biomass ratio** (Q/B): EwE annual Q/B → Informs mizer feeding parameters
   - Relates to maximum consumption rate and feeding level

4. **Diet Composition**: EwE diet matrix → Mizer interaction matrix + size-based preferences

5. **Fishing Mortality**: EwE fishing effort and catches → Mizer fishing mortality arrays

## Parameters Requiring Derivation

1. **Size-at-maturity** (w_mat): Need to derive from literature for each species

   - Fish: Well-documented for most species
   - Marine mammals: Age/size at sexual maturity
   - Penguins: Body mass at first breeding

2. **Asymptotic size** (w_inf): Maximum body size

   - Fish: L∞ from von Bertalanffy growth
   - Mammals/birds: Maximum adult body mass

3. **von Bertalanffy K**: Growth rate parameter

   - Fish: Available in literature for most species
   - Krill: K = 0.44 (from EwE model)
   - Mammals/birds: May need alternative parameterization

4. **Predator-Prey Mass Ratio** (beta): Preferred predator:prey size ratio

   - Derive from predator size and typical prey sizes in EwE diets
   - Literature values for feeding mode (benthic feeders, planktivores, piscivores, etc.)

5. **Feeding kernel width** (sigma): Size selectivity

   - Specialists: Narrow feeding kernel
   - Generalists: Broad feeding kernel

6. **Reproductive efficiency** (erepro): Conversion of energy to reproduction

   - Will need calibration to match biomass and recruitment patterns

## Research Needed for Marine Mammals/Seabirds

Key questions requiring literature review and potentially consultation with mizer experts:

1. How have previous mizer studies parameterized whales?
2. What approaches exist for modeling organisms with determinate growth?
3. How to represent annual breeding cycles in mizer's continuous time framework?
4. What are appropriate size ranges for adult-only representations?
5. How to handle extreme size differences between nekton and mammals/birds in the same model?

# Environmental Forcing Implementation

Based on Dahood et al. (2019) success with environmental forcing, the mizer model will incorporate:

## Sea Ice Forcing

**Data source**: ISIMIP3a `siconc` (sea ice concentration)

**Applications** (following EwE Table 3):

1. **Resource Availability Modulation**:

   - Resource carrying capacity can be modulated by sea ice cover
   - Higher ice → potentially higher resource availability (representing ice algae contribution)

2. **Krill Dynamics**:

   - EwE used sigmoidal response curve (sea ice index → large krill biomass)
   - Mizer implementation options:
     - Sea ice affects krill recruitment (R_max or erepro modulation)
     - Sea ice affects krill resource availability (modulate capacity of smaller resource sizes)
     - Sea ice affects krill mortality (overwinter survival)
   - **Most realistic**: Combination of resource availability modulation + recruitment modulation

3. **Predator-Prey Interactions**:

   - EwE forced Chinstrap-Krill interaction (1.33 SS reduction)
   - EwE forced interactions for Leopard Seal, Fur Seal
   - Mizer implementation: Research how to modulate interaction strength with environmental variables

## Open Water Forcing

**Data source**: Can derive from sea ice concentration (open water = 1 - ice cover)

**Applications** (following EwE Table 3):

1. **Gentoo Penguin** feeding:

   - Open water increases foraging success on on-shelf fish and krill

2. **Antarctic Fur Seal** feeding:

   - Open water increases foraging success (pelagic hunter)

3. **Fish interactions**:

   - EwE applied to C. gunnari and N. rossii interactions

## Plankton Forcing

**Data sources**: ISIMIP3a zooplankton fields (primary) and phytoplankton fields (optional future refinement)

1. **Extended Resource Spectrum (Phase 1 - Current)**:

   - Driven by zooplankton data only: `zmicro-vint` + `zmeso-vint`
   - Zooplankton biomass integrates phytoplankton dynamics through trophic interactions
   - Provides stable, biologically-relevant forcing
   - Avoids temporal mismatch between phytoplankton boom-bust and zooplankton lagged response

2. **Size-Dependent Forcing (Phase 2 - Future Option)**:

   - Small resource sizes (< 1e-6 g): Could be driven by phytoplankton data (`phydiat-vint`, `phydiaz-vint`, `phypico-vint`)
   - Large resource sizes (≥ 1e-6 g): Driven by zooplankton data (`zmicro-vint`, `zmeso-vint`)
   - Would better capture different dynamics across size spectrum
   - Requires custom capacity matrix implementation

3. **Chlorophyll-a**:

   - EwE applied chlorophyll forcing to primary production
   - ISIMIP data are vertically integrated biomasses, may correlate with chlorophyll
   - Can potentially derive chlorophyll-equivalent metric from phytoplankton biomasses if needed for validation

## Temperature Forcing

**Data sources**: ISIMIP3a `tob` (bottom temperature), `tos` (surface temperature)

**Potential applications** (not explicitly in EwE calibration but ecologically important):

1. **Metabolic rates**: Temperature-dependence of consumption and metabolism
2. **Growth rates**: Temperature affects growth efficiency
3. **Fish distributions**: Temperature may affect habitat suitability (not in non-spatial model but affects parameters)

**Implementation**: Mizer has built-in temperature dependence capabilities; need to evaluate if/how to use

# Summary: Model Structure Overview

## Complexity and Comprehensiveness

The translated mizer model will be **comprehensive**, representing:

- **26 size-structured species** (fish, euphausiids, seals, whales, penguins, salps)
- **1 extended resource spectrum** (representing phytoplankton, zooplankton, ice algae, benthic organic matter)
- **Multiple forcing mechanisms** (sea ice, open water, zooplankton dynamics, temperature)
- **Explicit krill fishery**
- **Full food web** from primary producers to apex predators

This is a **complex translation** that pushes mizer beyond its typical application domain (fish-focused models) to include air-breathing vertebrates. However, this comprehensiveness is justified by:

1. **Calibration requirements**: 8 monitored species need to be represented for model validation
2. **Ecosystem approach**: WAP ecosystem is truly krill-centric with multiple dependent predator groups
3. **Climate change focus**: Sea ice forcing affects multiple groups across taxa
4. **Management relevance**: Model designed to inform MPA planning, requiring multi-species representation

## Challenges and Innovations

**Challenges**:

- Representing marine mammals and seabirds in size-based framework
- Implementing EwE-style forcing in mizer
- Calibrating complex model with 26 species

**Innovations**:

- Extended single resource spectrum representing all lower trophic levels (fixes 99.5% resource deficit)
- Zooplankton-only forcing strategy to avoid temporal dynamics mismatches
- Comprehensive representation of Antarctic food web in mizer including air-breathing vertebrates

## Comparison to EwE Model

| Aspect | EwE Model | Mizer Model |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Groups/Species** | 35 functional groups | 26 species + 1 extended resource spectrum |
| **Size structure** | Multi-stanza for krill only | All 26 species size-structured |
| **Lower trophic levels** | 9 discrete groups | 1 extended continuous spectrum (1e-10 to 10 g) |
| **Spatial structure** | Homogeneous (non-Ecospace) | Homogeneous (non-spatial mizer) |
| **Temporal resolution** | Monthly time steps | Flexible (typically annual or finer) |
| **Predation** | Diet matrix + vulnerabilities | Size-based with interaction matrix |
| **Environmental forcing** | Forcing functions + response curves | Zooplankton forcing on resource capacity |
| **Calibration targets** | 8 species time series | Same 8 species time series |
| **Primary output** | Biomass trajectories | Biomass + size spectra + indicators |

The mizer translation **preserves the essential structure** of the EwE model while leveraging mizer's strengths in size-based dynamics and potentially providing additional insights from size spectrum analyses.
